	  <h2>About this database </h2>
		  <h3>Why was it written?</h3>
		  <p class="bodytext">This database celebrates the 18,000 plus individuals
		    who fought in the Battle of the Trafalgar on the
		    side of the Royal Navy. </p>
		  <p class="bodytext">The victory over the combined fleets of France and Spain,
		      as a result of the Battle of Trafalgar


on  21 October 1805, is considered
	        one of Britain's greatest and most significant military victories.
		    It thwarted Napoleon's plans to invade Britain at the time, and it
		    laid the foundation of Britain's undisputed mastery of the sea into
		    the twentieth century.</p>
		  <h3>What does it contain?</h3>
		  <p class="bodytext"><em>Trafalgar Ancestors</em>  lists all those who
		    fought in Nelson's fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar. This includes
		    Royal Navy commissioned and warrant officers, ratings, supernumeraries
		    and Royal Marines. Collectively these individuals were born in a
		    surprisingly wide range of continents and countries, for example,
		    Africa, America, West Indies, India, and most countries in Europe.
		    Moreover, <em>Trafalgar
		    Ancestors</em>,
		    contains reference to Jane Townshend - the only woman positively
		    identified as having served at Trafalgar.</p>
		  <p class="bodytext"><em>Trafalgar Ancestors</em> is an ongoing project which
		    over time aims to provide genealogical and service details about
		    these individuals from a range of published sources and documents,
		    but in particular the Admiralty records held by The National Archives.
		    The overall aim is to eventually revise, extend and bring up to date
		    Mackenzie's<em> Trafalgar
		    Roll</em>.</p>
		  <p class="bodytext">In 1805, the
		      Royal Navy employed around 110,000 individuals.
		    So, if your ancestor served in the Royal Navy in 1805, there is <strong></strong> roughly
		      a one in six chance that they served in the Battle of Trafalgar. <em>Trafalgar
		        Ancestors</em> can be searched by surname, but also using its advanced
		        search facility, by first name; age on 21 October 1805; birthplace;
	          ship's name; rating and rank.</p>
		  <h3 id="sources">What sources is it based on? </h3>
		  <h4>Ships' musters </h4>
		  <p class="bodytext">The key records that we hold which
		    underpin <em>Trafalgar Ancestors</em> are ships' musters drawn mainly from
		    the ADM 36 and ADM 37 series, which cover 1688 to 1842. These musters,
		    in effect pay records, list the names of all the crew serving on
		    board a ship at a particular time. For the ship's crew (but not usually
		    for officers and Royal Marines) musters provide individual's place
		    of birth and their age when joining the ship. They can also indicate
		    from which ship a person joined and what ship they were discharged
		    to. We hold such records for all the 33 ships that made up Nelson's
		    fleet at Trafalgar.</p>
		  <p class="bodytext">Ship's musters are the key source for piecing together the careers of
		    men that served in the Royal Navy in this period of time given that it
		    only began to systematically keep service records for every officer and
		    rating from the mid nineteenth century onwards.</p>
		  <p class="bodytext">It is straight forward to find out whether we hold 
		    a ship's muster - or indeed ship's logs if they are also of interest.
		    This can be done by typing the name of the ship and the dates required,
		    limiting the search to ADM records in our <a href="/catalogue/search.asp">catalogue
		    search form</a>.</p>
		  <h4>Certificates of service</h4>
		  <p class="bodytext">Other significant series of records we hold that are
		    being used in the compilation of the <em>Trafalgar Ancestors</em> database
		    are the records in ADM 29/1-96. These are certificates of service
		    compiled for officers and men who applied for a pension, gratuity,
		    or medal. Name searches of these records can be carried out using
		    our <a href="/catalogue/search.asp">catalogue</a>.</p>
		  <h4>Greenwich Hospital in-pensioners</h4>
		  <p class="bodytext">Many men that served at Trafalgar ended up in Greenwich
		    Hospital as resident in-pensioners. The National Archives holds in
		    ADM 73, the records of individuals' applications to enter the hospital.
		    These records which cover 1790-1865, are arranged by the initial
		    letter of the applicant's surname and by date. These applications
		    can contain a lot of detail about an applicant's service in the navy
		    and genealogical information about them.</p>
		  <h4>Passing certificates</h4>
		  <p class="bodytext">For officers, the main sources held by The National Archives
		    which are being used for Trafalgar Ancestors are passing certificates.
		    These records are a vital source for tracing information about the
		    early part of an officer's career. Lieutenant's passing certificates
		    in ADM 6, ADM 13 and ADM 107, which cover 1691-1902, relate to the examination
		    taken by junior officers who wished to gain a commission. They could take
		    the exam after serving at least 6 years in a junior capacity to assess
		    whether they were suitable candidates for a lieutenancy in the Royal Navy.
		    These records provide details of ships served and are often accompanied
		    by candidate's baptismal certificates. A List and Index Society nominal
		    index to these records is available in the reading rooms at The National
		    Archives.</p>
		  <h4>Survey returns</h4>
		  <p class="bodytext">Another rich source for officers are the various survey
		    returns that the Admiralty asked them to complete from 1817, which
		    can be found in ADM 6, ADM 9, and ADM 11. Officers were asked to
		    supply details of their careers so that the Admiralty could decide
		    who to employ in a rapidly shrinking navy after the Napoleonic wars
		    had ended in 1815. Although the information in some returns can be
		    unreliable, as many officers supplied details from memory, they can
		    provide useful clues in further tracing their services. The survey
		    returns complied by commissioned officers in 1817, and 1846 are held
		    by The National Archives in ADM 9 to which there are nominal indexes
		    in the reading rooms.</p>
		  <h4>Biographical works</h4>
		  <p class="bodytext">Biographical and service details about Nelson and his
		    fellow officers can also be found in standard reference biographical
		    works such as the <em>Dictionary
		    of National </em><em>Biography</em>, <em>The British Biographical Archive</em> and
		    specialist naval biographical sources such as <em>Biographia Navalis</em> by
		    J.Charnock; A Naval Biographical Dictionary by W.R.O'Byrne; <em>Marshall's
		    Naval </em><em>Biography</em> by J.Marshall; <em>The Commissioned Sea Officers
		    of the Royal Navy</em>, 1660-1815 by D.Syrett and R.L. Di Nardo; and Patrick
		    Marione's <em>The Complete Navy List </em><em>of the Napoleonic Wars</em>,
		    1793-1815, all of which are available in The National Archives'
		    <a href="http://www.library.nationalarchives.gov.uk/">reference library</a>,
		    or our Reading Rooms.</p>
		  <h3 id="credits">Who researched it? </h3>
		  <p class="bodytext">The contents of the &quot;Trafalgar Ancestors&quot; database
		    were researched and compiled by Bruno Pappalardo, Naval Specialist
		    at The National Archives. Bruno is the author of <a href="/bookshop/title_show.asp?title_id=97">Tracing
		    Your Naval Ancestors</a> available from our online bookshop. </p>

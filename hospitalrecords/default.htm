        <h2 class="redanddots" id="database" name="database">The Hospital Records Database</h2>
        <p class="mainbodytext">The information in this database has been obtained mainly from questionnaires completed by local authority record offices, supplemented by further research. A small number of hospitals which maintain their own archives have been included, but coverage of records still held by hospitals is limited.</p>



        <!-- p class="mainbodytext">The Hospital Records Database (HOSPREC) is not currently included in Discovery but we are looking at ways to incorporate the data in the future. While it remains separate from Discovery, it will not be possible to update the information it contains. Although this information was constantly being updated until recently, this had been difficult in cases when hospitals closed and information on the closure
          and the fate of records was not supplied.</p -->

<p class="mainbodytext">The Hospital Records database is no longer being updated. We continue to make this information available for inspection and reuse but can no longer guarantee its accuracy. The dataset was last updated in 2012 (many fields may be more out of date than this) and this should be borne in mind when using it - particularly the location of records may have changed. You can <a href="http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk">search Discovery</a> to find records held here at The National Archives and in other UK archives.</p>

        <p class="mainbodytext">Some hospital records are subject to closure periods,
          for example, access is not usually granted to the records of individual patients
          less than 100 years old, except via a doctor or social worker. It is always
          advisable to contact the archivist at the relevant repository before you visit.</p>
		  <p class="mainbodytext">
		  If you have an enquiry about the records of specific hospitals, you should contact the relevant repository directly. If you require further or more up to date information about the repositories, please use the <a href="http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/find-an-archive">Find an Archive tool, within Discovery.</a> Links to online catalogues which were previously available on Access to Archives (A2A) now redirect to <a href="http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/">Discovery</a>, and many more catalogues will be found by searching Discovery.
